  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Tender, sugar-crusted biscuits filled with macerated strawberries and fresh
     whipped cream, strawberry shortcake is a must during the spring and summer months.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>10 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch chunks</li>
      <li>¾ cup buttermilk (see note)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons turbinado sugar</li>
      <li>2 pounds strawberries, hulled and sliced ¼-inch thick</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam</li>
      <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1½ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Biscuits: Preheat the oven to 425°F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Line a 13x18-in baking sheet with parchment paper.
      In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, granulated sugar, and salt.
      Add the pieces of cold butter. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with pea-sized clumps of butter within. Add the buttermilk and stir with a rubber spatula until the dough comes together into a sticky, shaggy mass. Do not overmix.
      With lightly floured hands, form the dough into 8 craggy-looking balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. (They should be bigger than golf balls but smaller than tennis balls.) Don't worry about making them perfect -- it's better if they are a little rough around the edges. Sprinkle the tops with the turbinado sugar. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, until the biscuits are golden.</li>
      <li>Strawberries: Put one-third of the berries in a medium bowl and, using a potato masher or a fork, mash them into a chunky purée. Mix in the remaining berries, along with the raspberry jam and granulated sugar. Let the berries sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes, until saucy.</li>
      <li>Whipped Cream: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or beaters), whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the cream and beat until soft peaks return. Do not overbeat. (Alternatively, the whipped cream can be beaten by hand in a deep mixing bowl with a whisk.)</li>
      <li>Assemble the shortcakes: Using a serrated knife, split the biscuits in half horizontally and transfer the bottoms to 8 dessert plates. Spoon about three-quarters of the macerated berries and their juice evenly over the biscuit bottoms. Let some of the berries spill out onto the plate. Top with a generous dollop of whipped cream and cover each with a biscuit top. Spoon more berries and cream over each shortcake and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

        <li>The unbaked biscuits can be refrigerated for up to 1 hour before baking. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months. To freeze: place the unbaked biscuits on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze until solid. Remove the firm biscuits from the freezer, place in an airtight bag, and store in the freezer. Bake the biscuits directly from the freezer, allowing a few extra minutes baking time. The whipped cream can be made a few hours before serving but err on the side of under-beating. Store it covered in the refrigerator and give it a final whip by hand to get it to a pillowy consistency just before serving. The strawberries cannot be made ahead.</li>
