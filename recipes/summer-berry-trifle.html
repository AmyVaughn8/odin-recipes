  <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Berry trifles make wonderful summer party desserts. Not only are they gorgeous, 
      they feed a crowd and are made in advance.
    </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup (8 oz) seedless raspberry jam</li>
      <li>1 quart (1½ pounds) strawberries, hulled and cut into ¼-inch slices</li>
      <li>1 pint (12 oz) raspberries</li>
      <li>1 pint (12 oz) blueberries</li>
      <li>1½ cups heavy whipping cream, cold</li>
      <li>16 ounces cream cheese (preferably Philadelphia brand), at room temperature</li>
      <li>1¾ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 (7 oz) package crisp lady fingers (also called savoiardi biscuits)</li>
      <li>Fresh mint spring, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Set aside a few berries for topping the trifle.</li>
      <li>Heat the raspberry jam in a large bowl in the microwave for about 1 minute, or until hot and liquidy. Add the fresh berries and toss to coat. Let sit while you prepare the rest of the recipe, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In another large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with the powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. Beat in the vanilla, then beat in a third of the whipped cream. Using a large rubber spatula, fold in the rest of the whipped cream until well combined.</li>
      <li>Cover the bottom of a 9-inch (14-cup capacity) trifle dish or glass bowl with a layer of lady fingers (break into pieces as necessary). Follow with ⅓ of the berry-jam mixture (including ⅓ of the juices), then ⅓ of the cream. Alternate, ending with the cream cheese mixture on top; for the last layer of cream, leave a 1-inch border around the edge showing the fruit beneath. Garnish with the reserved whole berries and a fresh mint spring if using. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight, before serving.</li>
    </ol>
